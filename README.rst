OpenSSH Python wrapper
=======================

Under some circumstances simple wrapper around OpenSSH ``ssh`` command-line
utility seems more preferable than paramiko machinery.

This project proposes yet another hopefully thin wrapper around ``ssh`` to
execute commands on remote servers. All you need thereis to make sure that
OpenSSH client and Python interpreter are installed, and then install
`openssh-wrapper` package.

Usage sample
-------------

Simple command execution ::

    >>> from openssh_wrapper import SSHConnection
    >>> conn = SSHConnection('localhost', login='root')
    >>> ret = conn.run('whoami')
    >>> print ret
    command: whoami
    stdout: root
    stderr: 
    returncode: 0
    >>> ret.command
    'whoami'
    >>> ret.stdout
    'root'
    >>> ret.stderr
    ''
    >>> ret.returncode
    0

If python interpreter is installed on a remote machine, you can also run pieces
of python code remotely. The same is true for any other interpreter which can
execute code from stdin ::

    >>> ret = conn.run('whoami')
    >>> print conn.run('print "Hello world"', interpreter='/usr/bin/python').stdout
    Hello world

Yet another userful `run` method option is `forward_ssh_agent` (the feature
which paramiko doesn't yet have). Suppose you have access as support to foobar
server while root@localhost does not, so you can take advantage of SSH agent
forwarding ::

    $ eval `ssh-agent`
    Agent pid 5272
    $ ssh-add 
    Identity added: /home/me/.ssh/id_rsa (/home/,e/.ssh/id_rsa)
    $ python
    >>> conn = SSHConnection('localhost', login='root')
    >>> print conn.run('ssh support@foobar "whoami"', forward_ssh_agent=True).stdout
    support


There is a sample which shows how to copy a file from local to
remote machine. You can also define owner and mode of the target ::

    >>> fd = open('test.txt', 'w')
    >>> fd.write('Hello world')
    >>> fd.close()
    >>> from openssh_wrapper import SSHConnection
    >>> conn = SSHConnection('localhost', login='root')
    >>> conn.scp(('test.txt', ), target='/tmp', mode='0666', owner='nobody:')
    >>> print conn.run('cat /tmp/test.txt').stdout
    Hello world
    >>> conn = SSHConnection('localhost', login='root')
    >>> conn.put('test.txt', target='/tmp/', mode='0666', owner='nobody:')
    >>> print conn.run('cat /tmp/test.txt').stdout
    Hello world
    >>> conn = SSHConnection('localhost', login='root')
    >>> conn.get('/tmp/test.txt', target='/tmp/')
    >>> cat /tmp/test.txt
    Hello world
    >>> print conn.run('ls -l  /tmp/test.txt').stdout
    -rw-rw-rw- 1 nobody nogroup ... /tmp/test.txt


You can also pass file-like objects instead of filenames to scp method. Behind
the scenes the method creates temporary files for you, send them to remote
target and then removes everything which has been created::

    >>> from StringIO import StringIO
    >>> data = StringIO('test')
    >>> from openssh_wrapper import SSHConnection
    >>> conn = SSHConnection('localhost', login='root')
    >>> conn.scp((data, ), target='/tmp/test.txt', mode='0644')
    >>> print open('/tmp/test.txt').read()
    test
